<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About This Game

This is a small and fun little project, it serves as training and practice in introducing AI into the natural development workflow.
Use AI to produce the bulk of the code while orchestrating the project and how it ties together.

Developed without other libraries and frameworks, as vanilla as possible to pull the potential and usefulness out of AI.

Notes:
* This method gives a nice dive into working with code that isn't yours.
* Focus on what the project does and why, and move faster.
* Enjoy the labours of the machine :smile:
